# my neocities stuff

contains stuff for my neocities website, also deployed to github pages

## stuff in here

- the website, located in `web-src/`
- the blog generator, located in `blog-generator/`

## the difference between the deployed places

- the neocities page has the stuff from the "main" branch
  - normally being all the stuff that's actually finished
- the github pages page has the stuff from the "next" branch
  - so it tends to have the most recent, maybe not ready, stuff

## todo list

- actually make the neocities deploy part
  - leaving it to maybe after i get a proper building system (if i do end up using one)
  - can probably just do it right now since i have a Makefile anyways
- finish blog-generator/
  - unnecessary just like the existenc of it, but i wanna use it
  - only needs to generate the lil' list of blog posts rn, markdown to html seems to be working fine

## da end

and that's my very cool README.md that's very cool just like my markdown skills
