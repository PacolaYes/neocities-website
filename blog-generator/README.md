# the thing that generates my blog's html

## should you use this?

not really, i'm pretty sure something like [nob](https://github.com/nshebang/nob/), or even some other one that i don't know the existence of would be more of use to you than this thing i did

## "why'd u do it then"

i wanted to be just like Wario in hit WarioWare game WarioWare: D.I.Y. and make something on my own (i think wario does that, i didn't play any warioware games), even if its not the best option out there!!

## i'll use this anyways

alright, here's how 2 use it:

setp 1:  
do `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get da requirements

setp 2:  
(insert more proper instructions here later)
